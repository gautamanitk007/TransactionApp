# TransactionApp
This App Architecture is based on VIP(View, Interactor and Presenter).

Clean Swift (VIP) was first introduced by Raymond Law on his website clean-swift.com. 
The idea behind it was to tackle the Massive view controller problem while following the main ideas found in Uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Architecture.

Note:

1.Way to test this app in offline mode:
